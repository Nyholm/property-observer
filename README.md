# FSi PropertyObserver Component

PropertyObserver is a simple component which tracks changes in registered object's properties. It's usefull if i.e. we want to
check if some property of some object has changed since it was last checked.

## Setup and autoloading ##

We highly recommend to use autoloader generated by composer.phar

**Adding reflection into composer.json**

    {
        ... 
        "require": {
            ... 
            "fsi/property-observer": "0.9.*" 
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
